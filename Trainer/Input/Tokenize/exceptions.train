The suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London|, as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset|.
It was built of a bright brick throughout|; its skyline was fantastic|, and even its ground plan was wild|.

It was described with some justice as an artistic colony|, though it never in any definable way produced any art|.

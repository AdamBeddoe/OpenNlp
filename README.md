#OpenNlp

OpenNlp is an open source library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
It provides a number of NLP tools in C#:
* sentence splitter
* tokenizer
* part-of-speech tagger
* chunker
* coreference
* name entity recognition
* parse trees

This project started as a C# port of the Java OpenNLP tools (initial code was retrieved on http://sharpnlp.codeplex.com). It was moved to Github to improve the code (add new features and fix detected bugs) and create a nuget package.

You can install this library via nuget: Install-Package OpenNp
